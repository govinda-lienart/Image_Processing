# Image Processing Foundations with NumPy, PIL, SciPy, and matplotlib

Overview

I explored foundational techniques in image processing using Python libraries: NumPy, PIL, SciPy, and matplotlib. 
The project began with a ChatGPT-generated script to create random grayscale and RGB images, alongside guided exploratory questions. 
This repository includes code for image manipulation, filtering, and data visualization, providing hands-on practice in computer vision basics.

Project insight

	•	Image Generation: Using NumPy to create random grayscale and three-channel RGB images.
	•	Basic Transformations: Image manipulations including pixel value modification, color inversion, cropping, and 90-degree rotations.
	•	Filtering Techniques: Application of blurring and edge detection using SciPy’s convolution function.
	•	Data Visualization: Plotting pixel intensity histograms with matplotlib to analyze distribution.

Libraries Used

	•	NumPy: Array operations and image generation.
	•	PIL: Image file handling and transformations.
	•	SciPy: Convolution for applying filters.
	•	matplotlib: Visualization of pixel intensity histograms.

 Repository Contents
